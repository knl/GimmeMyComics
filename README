# GimmeMyComics (GMC)

This tool fetches different web comics, packages them in a simple email, and
ships the email to designed addresses.

The configuration is in `gmc.config`, which is a YAML file. This file contains:

- `message_body` - a string (that Perl evaluates), which will be substituted for
  the message body
- `from_address` - if needed, the address of the aledged sender
- `send_to_emails` - a list of emails to which the comics will be sent to. First
  one goes to `To:` field, while the rest is in `Bcc:`
- `subject` - self explanatory :)
- `timezone` - your's timezone, defaults to 'local'
- `comics` - a list of your comics. If a comics' name starts with two
  underscores (`__`), the comic will be skipped.

This tool tries to fetch the latest comics from the web. These comics are
usually images which reside at some URLs. In turn, these URLs have dates or
counters or whatnot embedded, to designate the latest comic. Thus, the
configuration describes how to fetch the latest strip. The fields are:

- `type`: defines the type of designator (date, counter, mixed, frompagedate, frompagecounter);
- `url`: contains the URL of where to look for the comic. `%s` in URL will be
  replaced by the designator;
- `ident`: the format of the designator. If it is a date, you can put something
  like `%Y%m%d` and the tool will replace it with the right date 
- `last`: the last used designator
- `pattern`: in case the type is `frompage`-kind, GMC first fetches the
  HTML code (as opposed to the actual image). Then, it tries to find the strip's
  image name, using the pattern. Use Perl's regex capture `()` to specify what
  is the filename.
